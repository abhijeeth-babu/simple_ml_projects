# Machine Learning Practice Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Practice Repository! This repository serves as a learning space with a focus on practical implementation. Currently, it features a project named "Waiter Tip Prediction," employing linear regression. Feel free to explore the code and dataset, experiment with adjustments, and use this space to reinforce your understanding of machine learning concepts. Additional projects may be added over time to further enhance your hands-on experience. Happy coding!
